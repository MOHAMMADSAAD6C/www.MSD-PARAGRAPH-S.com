Trees have the power to calm our senses and bring positiveness. We go far and wide to spend our holidays among nature. Lush trees, high mountains and condensed streams make for a quiet environment that refreshes us. While we can not get the same environment in the cities, although we can certainly plant more trees to make our environment peaceful and beautiful.

Areas of greenery provide a more peaceful environment. The air here is fresh and the atmosphere is cold. People living in such areas experience less stress and are happy, who form the basis of healthy community.

These schools provide education at a nominal fee and sometimes free too.
