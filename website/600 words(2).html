<b><i><p>Trees are very important to us. They give us oxygen and keep our environment clean by absorbing various harmful gases and pollutants from the environment. We can breathe freely and can lead a healthy life due to the presence of trees around them. However, even trees are so important that humans are cutting trees without ruthlessness, that cutting trees means that threatening our lives.

Deforestation - The Bitter Truth

Man is cutting forests rapidly in the name of development and urbanization. Many forests and green patches around the world have been cut in the last few decades to create space for the growing human population and to meet their ever increasing physical demands.

More and more people, these days, are moving from rural areas to urban cities. To accommodate them, residential areas are being expanded in cities and this is being done at the expense of trees. Trees are being cut in place and concrete forests are being constructed. Factories, offices and residential committees are being set up at those places which were once surrounded by beautiful green trees.

The trees are also being cut faster because the need for timber and other materials extracted from them is increasing day by day. Houses, tools, furniture, paper, medicines and many other things are made from wood. While these things are necessary for living, we should not forget that our first and foremost important requirement to survive on earth is oxygen. If we continue to cut the forest at this rate, the essential supply of oxygen will be reduced and it will be difficult to stay on this planet.

Deforestation also means loss of habitat of wild animals. Many species of animals have gone extinct from the face of the Earth in the past and many others are on the brink of extinction. One of the main reasons for this is deforestation. This has increased contact between humans and wild animals and they are constantly scared of each other. Other effects of deforestation include disruption of water cycle, erosion of soil and increased pollution and heat. These are equally bad for humans as well as animals.

Plant a tree - boost life

Man has become addicted to life. Many things we get from trees have become a necessity for us, due to which we have become deaf and blind to the deforestation and the upcoming danger.

When cutting trees, it is necessary to meet our many essential demands. Apart from this, to balance the act, we should take it as the responsibility of planting more and more trees. Each of us should plant trees regularly and take care of them too. Each neighborhood should conduct regular plantation activity.

Lessons should be given to students on saving trees and their importance. School management should conduct tree plantation activity regularly and encourage every student to participate in it. We will create better environment for ourselves and for generations to come and plant more trees. Similarly, regular activities should also be done to water the trees and promote their growth. This will help them to bloom fast.

Conclusion

The importance of trees has been emphasized from time to time. It is time that we should realize that cutting trees is a threat to our own life. To maintain life on earth, deforestation should be stopped. The loss of trees will have to be replenished by planting many of them and plants. Every person should plant trees and contribute to keeping the environment clean.</p></i></b><br><br><br>
