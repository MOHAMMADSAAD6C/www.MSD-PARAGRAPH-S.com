<b><i><p>Trees, the part of nature, which has made our childhood enjoyable. You, I and everybody would've died without this asset. Nobody can imagine a life without trees. How could they after all only trees provide us the oxygen? Tree is an allrounder- Gives us oxygen, food, can be played with and could be a great source for wickets for those who love cricket.<center><img src="C:\Users\NIKHILL\Downloads\lonely-japanese-cherry.jpg"width= 50% lenghth="50%"></center> Trees have never done a single harm to us. Yet, why are we repaying badly for it's great deeds? The answer is - Human ignorance. People don't care about trees. They cut them down without thinking of future. They don't see, if they cut them down, they're killing themselves with the trees. Less trees, less oxygen, less rain, droughts, no supply of foods and finally, death. Indeed, trees are the best gifts we've received from nature!</p></i></b>
