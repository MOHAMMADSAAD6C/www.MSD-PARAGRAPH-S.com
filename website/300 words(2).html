<b><i><p>Trees are an essential part of the environment. They make the environment beautiful and fit for the existence of various species of organisms. Life on the earth will not be possible without trees. They are important to us in many ways. It would not be wrong to say that trees give us life.

Trees give us oxygen

One of the essential conditions for human existence is oxygen and it is provided by trees. Tree carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen. The more trees we plant, the more oxygen we get, the more we get. That is why going for a morning walk in a park full of green trees and plants helps us to revive our senses and make us feel refreshed.

Trees Absorb harmful gases

Trees not only breathe carbon dioxide but also absorb other harmful gases such as carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide from the environment. Various other pollutants are also absorbed by trees. This process purifies the air and keeps the atmosphere clean. By increasing maximum trees, increasing pollution in the environment can be reduced.

Trees provide food

Trees extinguish our hunger. Different trees give different types of fruits rich in various micro-nutrients. Fruits are eaten raw and fresh and even in their dried forms. Other parts of trees such as leaves, root and bark are also used to prepare various food items. Tree leaves, fruits and bark are also used to prepare herbal medicines which help in fixing various diseases.

Trees provide shelter

Trees provide shade and people work as well as shelter for animals. They offer a cold place to sit on hot summer days. Trees also provide wood which is used to make homes and furniture.

Conclusion

The trees are life saving. We can enjoy the good quality life only when there are abundant trees around us. We should avoid cutting trees and planting more of them. We should also encourage people around us to plant trees.</p></i></b>
