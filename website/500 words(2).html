<b><i><p>Trees play an important role in balancing and maintaining the Earth's ecological system. Green trees and plants fill the atmosphere with oxygen, clean the air, prevent soil erosion, support wildlife and assist in climate control. Here is a brief look at how trees help in maintaining the ecosystem in all these processes.

Purification of air

Our environment is filled with all kinds of harmful gases including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. Increasing number of vehicles on the road and the increasing number of factories around the world is increasing the level of these harmful gases in the environment. Leaves carbon dioxide and pure and fresh oxygen in the trees that we humans require for our existence. Trees also absorb other harmful gases to keep our environment clean. This is the reason that more trees with more trees are less polluted.

We should plant trees to clean and clean our environment.

Promoting biodiversity

Jungle works as a house for wildlife. Trees provide shelter to many species of birds and animals. Thus, they promote biodiversity. Deforestation, which is one of the main concerns these days, has harmed biodiversity. Animals and birds are losing their habit and they are difficult to survive. Researchers claim that more damage to biodiversity can have adverse effects on the ecosystem. This is because animals and plants are dependent on one another to meet their many needs. Avoiding more trees and deforestation can help promote biodiversity and maintain ecological balance.

Prevent soil erosion

Heavy rainfall causes erosion of soil which inhibits the life of people living in the affected areas. The roots of the trees catch the soil and save it from the bloom as it rains. Large trees absorb sufficient amount of water and reduce the possibility of depositing sediments in the rivers. Earthen erosion causes many problems such as water level in rivers and rivers. It harms marine life and often results in flood. By stopping soil erosion, trees help in maintaining ecological balance.

Conserve Energy

Areas surrounded by trees are coolers. People living in such areas do not have to constantly keep their air conditioners. This helps in the conservation of energy. It is also a good way to reduce the emissions of harmful gases and pollutants.

Balance the water cycle

Trees help in balancing the water level in the atmosphere. Large trees leave the water in good quantity in the atmosphere. This process replens the clouds and it rains. Plays a major role in the forest water cycle around the world and help in maintaining the ecosystem. Planting is the method of balancing the water cycle which is important for maintaining the environment intact. Deforestation on the other hand disrupts the cycle of water, resulting in negative soil like dry soil, loss of crops etc.

Conclusion

Thus, trees for the environment are extremely important. They help in maintaining the ecosystem and making life possible on Earth. The more trees we create for ourselves a better environment.
